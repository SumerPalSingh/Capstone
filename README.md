# Capstone-
The project for my final Year

Indian Sign Language Learning Platform
This project is a capstone project focused on creating an Indian Sign Language (ISL) learning platform that helps users learn ISL through interactive quizzes and provides feedback using computer vision technology.

Project Overview
The platform allows users to:

Learn basic and intermediate signs of Indian Sign Language.
Take quizzes to test their knowledge of different signs.
Receive real-time feedback on their signing accuracy using a camera, powered by computer vision.
The computer vision model tracks hand movements and compares them with correct signs to provide guidance and corrective feedback.

Key Features:
Interactive Lessons: Users can explore various signs with clear instructions and video demonstrations.
Quizzes: Interactive quizzes help users practice the signs theyâ€™ve learned.
Real-time Feedback: Using computer vision, the system provides feedback on the accuracy of the performed sign compared to the correct version.
Progress Tracking: Users can track their performance and improvement over time.
Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python (Flask/Django)
Computer Vision: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras (for sign recognition)
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
Camera Integration: JavaScript and WebRTC for capturing sign videos
Quizzes: Dynamic quizzes created using React/Angular/Vue.js
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/isl-learning-platform.git
Install the necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Open the platform in your browser at http://localhost:8000.
Usage
Sign Up/Login: Create an account or log in to access the lessons and quizzes.
Learning: Browse through the different categories of signs and watch the demonstrations.
Quiz Mode: Test your knowledge through quizzes. The camera will be activated to capture your sign.
Feedback: The system will analyze your sign using computer vision and provide feedback on how close it is to the correct sign.
Roadmap
Prototype Version: The current version is a prototype and is not the final version. This prototype demonstrates the core functionality of the learning platform.
Final Version: The final version, with more features and refinements, will be uploaded after the project undergoes final evaluation and testing.
